# COMP30019 – Graphics and Interaction

## Workshop 9


# Introduction:

In this workshop you will be constructing the beginnings of a simple game called _Cube Invaders_.
In particular, you will practice using the component based architecture offered by Unity, and learn
how it can be used to put together interactive applications rapidly. The game will be rendered 
in a 3D environment, but will be played in the x-z plane (e.g., it's a "2.5D" game). 
Therefore, unless stated otherwise, game objects will be assumed to have a y-position of 0.

### Tasks:

#### 1. Familiarise yourself with the template

Open `MainScene.unity` in Unity. Press the ‘Play’ button. You’ll notice that a ‘player ship’ is 
at the bottom of the screen, and can move left and right when you press the respective arrow keys.
Now open the `PlayerController.cs` and examine the code. Notice how `Input.GetKey()` is used to poll
whether the left and/or right arrow keys are currently pressed every frame. The `transform.Translate()`
method applies a translation accordingly. At this point it might help to re-familiarise yourself with the
Unity [`Input`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.html) class, as well as the 
[`Transform`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html) component API.

#### 2. Create an enemy

Create a cube game object to serve as an enemy. Also create a red material asset, like the
player's material currently, and apply this to the enemy. At this stage the enemy will not 
do anything when the game is run, it's just a placeholder.

#### 3. Make it a prefab

Create a *prefab* from the enemy object you created. This can be done simply by dragging the
game object from the hierarchy to the assets folder. Making the enemy a prefab will allow it 
to be instantiated such that you can place many identical enemies in the scene. 
Importantly, if a modification is made 
directly to the prefab, then every instance of it will automatically reflect the modification.

> **Note**<br>
> Prefabs are an essential tool in Unity game development, and can save you an enormous amount
> of time if used well. If you haven't already, make sure you have an in-depth read
> of the respective Unity manual [pages](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html) 
> discussing the prefab system in detail.

#### 4. Generate a swarm of enemy cubes (yikes!)

Delete the enemy game object (_not_ the prefab) from the scene. Remember that because you created a 
prefab asset from the enemy earlier, the "template" to produce enemies is still there! We will 
now write some game logic to instantiate a swarm of enemies and bring them to life, using this
prefab as the template.

<p align="center">
  <img src="Gifs/task_4.gif">
</p>

Open the script `SwarmManager.cs`. Notice that it is currently attached to the 
**EnemySwarm** game object. Complete the `GenerateSwarm()` method in `SwarmManager.cs`. 
The method should instantiate a swarm of enemies in a "grid" formation. 
Make use of the already given serialized fields to determine the number of rows and columns 
the grid of enemies comprises of, as well as the spacing between enemy cube instances.
You will need to use the 
[`Instantiate`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.Instantiate.html) method 
to create actual instances of the given prefab reference. Ensure the serialized field in
the editor is correctly assigned the enemy prefab you created, currently stored in the game assets. A 
drag and drop will do the trick, as usual.

It's a good idea to make the enemies children of the swarm 
manager game object in the object hierarchy. This way, transforming the swarm object will transform 
all the enemies together, without the need for maintaining an explicit list
of enemy instances. You may use the [`transform.SetParent`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.SetParent.html)
method to do this, or it's also possible to do it using one of the
[`Instantiate`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.Instantiate.html) method overloads.

#### 5. Animate the swarm, classic space-invaders style

Now complete the `StepSwarm()` method in `SwarmManager.cs`. This method 
should move all the enemies across the screen one step. If the enemy 
swarm has reached the edge of the playing area, the enemies should move 
down one step and reverse their stepping direction, just like classic space 
invaders. Note that the script already contains logic to
call `StepSwarm()` every `stepTime` seconds. 

> **Note**<br>
> We use a _coroutine_ to periodically step the swarm, however we could have 
> also achieved this by using a private timer variable that is incremented every frame and resets 
> when it exceeds `stepTime`. This is bit messy though, 
> and a coroutine offers an arguably cleaner way
> to solve this problem. If you are interested in learning more about coroutines,
> check out [this page](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html).

#### 6. Engage your defenses!

Create a new prefab which represents a player projectile. Pressing 'Space' 
should fire a projectile instance upwards towards the enemy swarm. If the 
projectile collides with an enemy cube, it should be destroyed as well as the 
projectile itself. You will find the [`Destroy()`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.Destroy.html) 
method comes in handy here. 

> **Warning**<br>
> Ensure that projectiles which miss and fly off the screen are 
> eventually destroyed. Otherwise you'll be creating a 'memory leak' of sorts,
> at least until the scene ends. Try to create a component that can be re-used for
> this purpose, e.g., when attached to any game object, it will automatically
> destroy it if it's no longer visible.

#### 7. Stronger enemies...

Modify the game such that the enemies have health, and so aren’t destroyed 
by just one projectile. Enemies should change visually in some way to reflect 
the loss in health (i.e. darken in colour). You should think about
designing any components you create for this in a modular and reusable way. For example,
you could create a `HealthManager.cs` script which simply tracks the "health" of a game object. This
could eventually be used for different types of enemies, "bosses" and the player themselves. Even
static/non-living objects could eventually make use of it, if they can be destroyed by projectiles.

For an extra challenge, you can try making use of [Unity events](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Events.UnityEvent.html),
such that an event is fired when an object is destroyed, or health is depleted. This is another
useful tool that helps further decouple components and maximise re-usability. If you can't 
figure this out yourself, don't worry, the solution will provide an example approach.

#### 8. Particle effects

Using a [particle system](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ParticleSystem.html), 
generate a suitable 'explosion' effect that is triggered 
when an enemy cube is destroyed. Prefabs will once again be your friend. Ensure 
the explosions are randomly varied 
in some way from enemy to enemy. Feel free to be creative with this exercise, and
try tuning all the different particle attributes in the editor interface -- there are heaps!

Also create some separate "spark" particles for the projectile 
when it is destroyed against an enemy cube. The sparks should fire 
in the _opposite_ direction to the
projectile's velocity in order to provide a sense of impact. Again think about the potential 
re-usability of what you create. The enemies will eventually fire 
their own projectiles at the player,
so perhaps it's worth refactoring your code to generalise your approach.

#### 9. Object pools (extension)

Consider what would happen to your game's performance if there were hundreds or even 
thousands of game objects created and/or destroyed each second (e.g. rapid fire projectiles). 
Sometimes it is worth utilising "object pools" to recycle objects 
rather than continually instantiating and destroying them, as there is most certainly a cost
associated with this. Research techniques 
for implementing object pools in Unity, and as an exercise, you might wish to try 
implementing an object pool 
for the projectiles (and particle systems) presently implemented. 

#### 10. Extend the game yourself (extension)

We'll continue to develop this project into more of an actual game next week! In the meantime,
experiment with what you have created today and develop the game further yourself. For example,
you could make the enemy cubes fire their own projectiles that can destroy the player, or you can
create different types of enemies with varying health levels. If you want more practice with the graphics side of things, 
make the "damaged" enemy cubes visually a little less boring than a darker shade of red 
(perhaps practice writing a shader here).

Remember that game development requires a lot of practice and initiative, as does software development generally. 
Ensure that you're tinkering with Unity in your spare time as much as possible while work
on project 2 continues...
